The files in this directory contain non-printing bytes.
They may cause issues with your terminal when displayed.
Editing them may destroy or convert the data they contain.

In order to replay these requests, you may need the following tools:
 * netcat (nc) or a similar raw network program
   - I've successfully used "nc localhost 8880 < file"
   - and "nc -c localhost 8880" interactively
 * unix2dos, as HTTP requires CRLF line endings
 * a URL encoder and decoder (i.e. util/URLUtil.java or a similar script)
   - This will assist with generating correct binary output from fuzzer output
   - A simple python script is:

       import sys, urllib as ul; 
       for line in sys.stdin:
       	   print ul.quote_plus(line)
# or, for decoding:
      	   print ul.unquote_plus(line)

Combining these techniques leads to command-lines like this:
cat sample.http.encoded | urldecode | unix2dos > sample.http
nc localhost 8880 < sample.http
