This is an Internal Test Tor Directory Cache</p>

<p>
Most likely you are accessing this website because you had some issue with
the traffic coming from this IP. This directory cache is an internal test 
node on the <a
href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Anonymity Network</a>, which is
dedicated to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview">providing
privacy</a> to people who need it most: average computer users.</p>

</a></p>

<p>
Tor sees use by <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers">many
important segments of the population</a>, including whistle blowers,
journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive
censorship, abuse victims, stalker targets, the US military, and law
enforcement, just to name a few.  While Tor is not designed for malicious
computer users, it is true that they can use the network for malicious ends.
In reality however, the actual amount of <a
href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq-abuse">abuse</a> is quite low. This
is largely because criminals and hackers have significantly better access to
privacy and anonymity than do the regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals
can and do <a
href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_tools.html">build,
sell, and trade</a> far larger and <a
href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_distributing_your.html">more
powerful networks</a> than Tor on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this
operator, the social need for easily accessible censorship-resistant private,
anonymous communication trumps the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are
almost always more easily uncovered by traditional police work than by
extensive monitoring and surveillance anyway.</p>

<p>
In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Tor is to consider it a
network of routers operating as common carriers, much like the Internet
backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers
explicitly do not contain identifiable routing information about the source of
a packet, and no single Tor node can determine both the origin and destination
of a given transmission.</p>

<p>
This node is an internal test directory cache on an anonymised 
network.
As such, there is little the operator of this test node can do 
to help you track connections on the public tor network. Attempts to
seize this router will accomplish nothing.</p>

</ol>

<p>
That being said, if you still have a complaint about this node,  you may
email the <a href="mailto:<FIXME: insert email address to be notified of misconfigurations>">maintainer</a>.</p>

<p>
You also have the option of blocking exit IP addresses on
the Tor network if you so desire. The Tor project provides a <a
href="https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py">web service</a>
to fetch a list of all IP addresses of Tor exit nodes that allow exiting to a
specified IP:port combination, and an official <a
href="https://www.torproject.org/tordnsel/dist/">DNSRBL</a> is also available to
determine if a given IP address is actually a Tor exit server. Please
be considerate
when using these options. It would be unfortunate to deny all Tor users access
to your site indefinitely simply because of a few bad apples.</p>
